# AD-pentest-methodology

Methodology to actually get somewhere during an engagement.

Packet capture to understand better the network
Host discovery  | arp, dns, llmnr, smb, ping sweeps, widening the attack surface
Host enumeration | port scans, service identifaction
Setting up ntlmrelayx.py, mitm6.py, responder and waiting for events
If nothing useful comes back launch a vulnerabilty against the subnet
If something comes back:
Hash cracking using hashcat
Inital access using psexec.py, smbexec.py, evil-winrm and the obtained hashes/passwords
Get a stable shell, dump creds...etc
Get sharphound, make it work and map out the network
Attack highly priviliged targets and take over the network.
